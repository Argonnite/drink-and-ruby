Now I am alone.
O what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
Is it not monstrous that this player here,
But in a fiction, in a dream of passion
Could force his soul so to his own conceit?
That in all her working
All his visage wan'd
Tears in his eyes, distraction in'nis aspect
A broken voice
And his whole function suiting with forms to his conceit.
And all for nothing.
For Hecuba!
